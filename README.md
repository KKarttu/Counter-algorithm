# Counter-algorithm

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Streaming services and social media, or even search engines, are nowadays feeding you information or entertainment which you have previously shown to be interested in. 
This lessens your exposure to new forms of information, opinions or entertainment effectively inreasing the effect that people are living in their own bubbles.
The idea of Counter-algorithm is to for example provide content 1/3 based on what you already like, 1/3 somewhat close to what you like and 1/3 something completely new to you.
 
## Background

More and more people live in their own bubbles, unexposed to alternative opinions, content etc. This can clearly be seen in the polarisation of politics, but also in other less serious matters like streaming services
suggesting similar content to what you already like.

## How is it used?

Applications like X, facebook, Spotify, Netflix etc. could try using a different algorithm that would partly force you content that is different from what you already like and follow. 

## Data sources and AI methods

Data comes from user data on various services.

## Challenges

All these services are provided by private companies, and they might not be interested in making user experience more "difficult" for users. People also
might not even want to see or hear anything out of their ordinary selection.

There is also the ethical question that is it right to force people on something, but on the other hand currently existing algorithms are already directing us and forcing content for us.

## What next?

I´m not an IT guy, this is merely an idea that came to me while finalizing Building AI course. Putting this idea to practice might even be impossible, but it´s at least food for thought.
